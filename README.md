# CS330 README: Q&A
<br><ul>
  <li> <b>How do I approach designing software?</b></li>
  
  <ul><li> <i>What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?</i>
  <br> Design skills that I developed while working on the project include the ability to draw and physically map out a design that I am trying to make. Usually, I write a list of things that I need to do in order, but since I was working with three-dimensional objects I had to start sketching out beforehand how things would look on the plane that I used. Especially as I move more towards front-end development, drawing out the layouts that I wish to make is a design skill that I hope to carry from this project to future projects.

  <ul><li> <i>What design process did you follow for your project work?</i>
  <br> First, I kept the digital photos of my scene open on a second screen so I could use them as reference while coding on my first screen. Next, I sketched out the scene on paper so I could pinpoint where x, y, and z coordinates should be when I create vertices. After that, I referenced lessons and tutorials from this course to create the different objects.

  </li></ul>
  
  <ul><li><i>How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?</i>
    <br> These tactics from my design can be applied to future works by taking more time to plan my designs and codes before actually writing them. It can be time consuming to just write from scratch, so it helps to work section by section and plan for as long as possible before actually putting things into motion.

  <li><b> How do I approach developing programs?</b></li>
    <ul><li> <i>What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?</i>
      <br> New development strategies that I used while working on my 3D scene included organizing codes into sections that make sense in sequential order rather than coding based on what I felt like coding at that moment. By doing this, it helped me to visualize how OpenGL works from setting up variables to setting up arrays to creating VBOs and VAOS to actually drawing the items once textures and shaders were created. Doing this also made finding errors easier, so I hope to continue this when working on other programs.

    <ul><li> <i>How did iteration factor into your development?</i>
      <br>(I am not sure why github is turning this into a textbox)
      <br> Iteration factored into my development when I worked in different stages, starting with planning and moving on to sketching and then coding. Each time I ran into a wall, I returned to the planning stage again, made updates to sketches if necessary, and then made changes based on the different tactics that I created during the next iteration of the planning stage.

<ul><li> <i>How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?</i>
  <br> My approach to development evolved throughout the milestones through the introduction of approaching programs from multiple angles. Before this course, I only considered that there was a "right" and "wrong" way to create a program and that there was little flexibility beyond that. After this course, though, I realized that there are many different tactics available. For example, our weekly videos approached drawing one way, but the tutorials in each module's assignment approached it another way. No way was "right" or "wrong". It just offered different perspectives on how to accomplish the same task. In short, I evolved through accepting more flexibility and learning to choose what feels organic to the plans I create.

  <li><b>How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?</b></li>
<ul><li> <i>How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?</i>
  <br> Computational graphics and visualizations gave me new knowledge/skills that can be applied to school by teaching me what goes into designing objects in 3D
