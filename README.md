  <li> <b>How do I approach designing software?</b></li>
  
  <ul><li> <i>What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?</i>
  <br> Design skills that I developed while working on the project include the ability to draw and physically map out a design that I am trying to make. Usually, I write a list of things that I need to do in order, but since I was working with three-dimensional objects I had to start sketching out beforehand how things would look on the plane that I used. Especially as I move more towards front-end development, drawing out the layouts that I wish to make is a design skill that I hope to carry from this project to future projects.
